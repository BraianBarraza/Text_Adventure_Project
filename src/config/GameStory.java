                It's been 5 long years since that terrible day.
                Sometimes when I look down, I still see that blood stain on my boot.
                if I would have stopped them, if only I would have said something
                but I did nothing, that's why I swore never to hold a gun again...
                
                but now I have to do it. But this time it is different.
                'cause they are ... they are already death
                
                I should watch the news and check if theres some new information about them
                
                Tutorial: use "2. Search" to discover what a room or a place contains, but be careful,
                you can also find some unpleasantry surprises.
                If you feel lost or dont know where to go, use "3. Player Status", it will gives you information about your 
                current place and room.
